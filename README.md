# Altium_Components_Library
These are custom components for Altium that are not provided by Altium directly. These component libraries can be imported from Eagle, and have been correctly adjusted, or custom made.

This repository should be placed in "C:\users\Public\Documents\Altium\AD15\Library". To not confuse this repository with the standard one provided by Altium please name the directory it copies itself into 'Custom' so that the path is: "C:\users\Public\Documents\Altium\AD15\Library\Custom". To do this use the following command when in the above specified path:

```
#!sh
$ git clone https://github.com/sabinoj/Altium_Components_Library.git Custom 
```

Inside the Custom folder the organization struture should follow that each library should be to one manufacturer and should be placed in a folder named of that manufacturer. In the event that there is no manufacturer because of a completly custom component place it in a folder labeled UIC and a subfolder labeled after what project/organization/class it pertains to.
